=====

[Fake RT as a Service (FRaaS)][fraas] is a service to provide fake
shameful tweet messages to make fun with your friends. This was
already a thing in a friends circle, but, well, it was 100% manual:

1. find a very ridiculous quote;
2. copy it to twitter;
3. reference the friend and put a 'RT' in the front.

This service helps people. Just access the service and put you friend username,
it will give you a fake ridicuous quote, and all you have to to is to
click a button.

This is the new era... everything automated, including fake RT's...

The bad thing is that this might be out of control and no one will
ever know when a tweet is legit...

You can also add some horrible music quotes to the `rts.txt` file,
travis-ci will run it and deploy automatically...
